			Hello , I'm Alice

		<p id="introduction">
			I am a huge <strong>fan of the 7 arts</strong>. Whatever they are, they fascinate and transport me. Having been brought up by parents who love this medium enormously, I was able to discover the joy of walking through a museum from a very young age. Afterwards I tried my hand at several activities such as <strong>architecture, classical music, dance, design, photography or even fashion</strong> at the Villa Noailles which is an art foundation in Hyères Les Palmiers.

		<h2>My artistic practice</h2>
		<p>
			After years of classical dance I opened myself to singing and music itself. I did 9 years of flute which were accompanied by 7 years of music theory and 4 years of choir, theater and orchestra.
Today I continue in this voice by using my free time to participate in the musical of IÉSEG.

		<h2>IÉSEG and my passion</h2>
		<p>
			I aspire to become an event organizer for the arts. Whether it is fashion shows or art openings, working for these types of events would be a real opportunity for me. It is in this sense that I chose to join IÉSEG in order to benefit from a complete training as well as a diploma allowing me to continue to live in this environment. Moreover, with the musical I can continue my artistic practice during my studies.

		<h2>An interest in sailing</h2>
		<p>
			I have done a lot of sailing since I was born thanks to my father. I have done some regattas on different types of boats. And I can't explain why but I am just happy when I am on or next to a boat, I think that's why I like sailing. Added to that, my father is now the president of the AFCA association, in charge of a historical naval building, the FRANCE.
